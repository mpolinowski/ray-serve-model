I earlier looked at [Wine Dataset](https://github.com/mpolinowski/scikit-wine-quality) and used a couple of __SciKit Learn Classifier__ to fit different models to this data to make a binary classification _"Is this wine any good?"_ based on a set of features provided by the dataset. Let's see how we can provision a prediction API based on the trained models using Ray.
